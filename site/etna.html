    <h1>My trip to Mt. Etna</h1>
    
    <p> Written by Katherine, 20th September 2015. We visited Mt. Etna on 14th July 2015.</p>
    
    <p>Mount Etna is a stratovolcano, that first started to erupt about 500,000 years ago. It frequently erupts, here are two of the dates that it erupted:  January to April 2012, and again in July to October 2012.</p>
