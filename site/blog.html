    <em>Anel is my mum. She takes me to London for fun and to work to give me a better education. I'm homeschooled and I DEFINITELY enjoy it a lot! We go to places like the Guardian headquarters to learn about coding, history, journalism, science, all the topics you could think of. We don't just go to London though! We go to places all over the UK!
    I give credit to the Guardian, who gave me the idea to start a blog online!</em>

    <em> Today I learnt about coding, and decided to make this alongside another website that isn't public called Making your own, not perfect though, website. It was very fun to learn about it and do it! Enough about coding for now, and more about the activities we do! In London we go to places like the Science Museum, Kidzania, the Canal Museum, British Library, Salters Hall, I could list a million more places! Since I've started being homeschooled I've made loads of great friends, and stereotyping that homeschooled kids are less socialised is wrong.</em>

           <p><em>Today I got up nice and late and then we took the dogs to the parlour. I do some tutoring called Kumon daily, and today I did it in the car on the way there. Then I did a mental maths workout and after that afew pages on my Brain Quest book. When we got home me and my mom started making some papermache snakes, it was SOOOO much fun! We made a really big mess in the kitchen though...</em></p>

           <p><em>Today I woke up at around eleven am and finished reading a book called: ' The Weight Of Water '. It was a very good book I must say! Then I did my daily Kumon. After that I wrote this paragraph and the 16th of May paragraph as I didn't have any time to do it on the day. Now we are going to maybe watch a bit of TV as this is our chill day!</em></p>
