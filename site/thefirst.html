    <em>How do you do this?</em>
        
        I use a brilliant coding app you could say,
        it is called Brackets.There are many apps
        like Brackets, some, like itself, are
        downloaded of the internet. 
        But I definitely reccomnd Brackets!

    <em>How long does it take?</em>
        
    Honestly, it depends on the size of the website, the productivity the person making it and the layout of the website you are planning to create. This website will take quite short as it is a simple, quick website to make ( another hopefully ).

        <em>Having a job at this, is it stressful?</em>
        Well, I wouldn't know as I'm a kid who likes to programme not a programmer. So I asked two people, both programmers for different companies. Here is what the first said:
       "If I don't get a job done on time, The Guardian" (She works for the Guardian)"will just say something along the lines of; Try to get it done now, it is ok if you get it done a bit late". Now the second, my dad, who works for his own company who works for another company
